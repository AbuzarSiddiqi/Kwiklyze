## What Should Happen

### When AI Works ✅

**In Console:**

```
🐾 Companion Pet mounted and ready!
👋 Initial greeting...
🐾 Companion Pet: Initiating conversation...
🤖 Calling Groq AI for spontaneous thought...
💬 AI thought received: Hey! Just wanted to check in - how are you feeling? 💙
```

**On Screen:**

- Floating pet emoji (😄/🥰/🤩) bouncing
- After 10 seconds: Speech bubble appears
- AI message shows up next to pet
- Pet moves to random position

### If There's an Error ❌

**In Console:**

```
❌ Companion Pet error: [error message]
```

**On Screen:**

- Fallback message: "Hey! Just checking in - how are you doing? 💙"

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Pet appears but doesn't talk

**Solutions:**

1. **Click the pet manually** to trigger conversation
2. Check console for errors
3. Verify internet connection (Groq API needs network)
4. Wait full 10 seconds

### Problem: No pet visible

**Solutions:**

1. Scroll to see if it's off-screen
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)

### Problem: API Error in console

**Possible Issues:**

1. **Rate Limit**: Groq free tier has limits
2. **Network**: Check internet connection
3. **CORS**: Should work (dangerouslyAllowBrowser enabled)
4. **API Key**: Already configured correctly

## Expected First Interaction

Pet: "Hey there! 👋 I'm KwikLyze! What should I call you?"
or
Pet: "Hi! Just checking in - how's your day going? 💙"
or
Pet: "Hello! Ready to make today awesome? ✨"
```

**Scenario 2: You click pet**

```
Pet: "Hey! What's on your mind? 😊"
or
Pet: "I'm here! How can I help? 💫"
or
Pet: "You called? Tell me everything! 🥰"
```

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Pet visible and bouncing  
✅ Console shows "mounted and ready"  
✅ After 10 sec OR click: AI message appears  
✅ Speech bubble shows AI-generated text  
✅ Console shows Groq API call

## If Everything Fails

### Emergency Fallback

The app will still work with fallback responses even if Groq API fails:

- Pet will show: "Hey! Just checking in - how are you doing? 💙"
- AI Assistant will show: "I'm here with you! 💫 Tell me more!"

### Check This

1. Browser: Use Chrome or Firefox (best compatibility)
2. Network: Verify internet connection
3. Console: Look for actual error messages
4. Page: Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

**Your AI should be working NOW! 🎉**

Look for the bouncing emoji and either:

- **Wait 10 seconds** for auto-greeting
- **Click the pet** for immediate interaction
- **Type testLivingAI()** in console to verify

The AI is ALIVE and ready to be your companion! 🤖💙
