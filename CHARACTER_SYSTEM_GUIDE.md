  - `happy` - For celebrations
  - `thinking` - When processing requests

  gender: 'Male' or 'Female',
  personality: 'Description',
  voice: 'VoiceName-PlayAI',
  description: 'Longer description',
  color: 'from-color-500 to-color-500',

    listening: '/path/listening.mp4',
    talking: '/path/talking.mp4',
    happy: '/path/happy.mp4',
    thinking: '/path/thinking.mp4',
  }
}
```

### Change Video Paths:
