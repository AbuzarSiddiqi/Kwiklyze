---

## 🎯 How It All Works Together

### Emotion Flow

```
User speaks → useAmbientSound detects amplitude
           ↓
EmotionContext.setVoiceAmplitude(amplitude)
           ↓
LivingBackground spawns particles
           ↓
EmotionGraphFusion updates timeline
```

### Daily Cycle

```
Morning (6 AM) → Dream Mode wakes → Morning greeting
                                  ↓
Day Activities → Environment shows sun/clouds
                              ↓
AI Journal Prompts (random times)
                    ↓
Evening (6 PM) → Environment transitions to night
                            ↓
Night (10 PM) → No activity for 2h → Dream Mode activates
```

### Immersive Layers (Z-Index)

```
1. LivingBackground (z-0) - Breathing gradient base
2. EnvironmentSimulator (z-10) - Particles, sun, moon
3. App Content (z-10) - Main UI with backdrop-blur
4. Dream Mode Overlay (z-30) - Night environment
5. AI Micro Moments (z-50) - Floating reactions
6. Modals (Mirror Mode, Journal) (z-40) - Full-screen overlays
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Trigger AI Moment from Console

```javascript
window.triggerAIMoment("achievement");
window.triggerAIMoment("surprise");
```

### Access Emotion Context in Component

```javascript
import { useEmotion } from "../context/EmotionContext";

function MyComponent() {
  const { currentMood, energyLevel, setMood } = useEmotion();

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setMood("happy")}>
      Feeling: {currentMood} (Energy: {energyLevel}%)
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Start Voice Analysis

```javascript
import { useAmbientSound } from "../hooks/useAmbientSound";

function MyComponent() {
  const { amplitude, startVoiceAnalysis, playSound } = useAmbientSound();

  useEffect(() => {
    startVoiceAnalysis();
  }, []);

  return <div>Voice Level: {Math.round(amplitude * 100)}%</div>;
}
```

---

## 🎨 Customization

### Change Emotion Colors

Edit `src/context/EmotionContext.jsx`:

```javascript
const colors = {
  happy: "#10b981", // green
  excited: "#f59e0b", // orange
  calm: "#3b82f6", // blue
  // ... add more
};
```

### Adjust Dream Mode Timing

Edit `src/components/DreamMode.jsx`:

```javascript
// Change sleep detection (default: 2 hours)
const timeSinceActivity = now - lastActivityTime;
if (timeSinceActivity > 7200000) {
  // 2 hours in ms
  setIsDreamMode(true);
}

// Change night hours (default: 10 PM - 6 AM)
const isNightTime = () => {
  const hour = new Date().getHours();
  return hour >= 22 || hour < 6;
};
```

### Modify Journal Prompts

Edit `src/components/AIJournal.jsx`:

```javascript
const journalPrompts = [
  { question: "Your custom question? 🌟", emoji: "🌟", category: "custom" },
  // ... add more
];
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Context Providers (Nested)

```jsx
<AIProvider>
  <ThemeProvider>
    <PersonalityProvider>
      <EmotionProvider>
        <AppContent />
      </EmotionProvider>
    </PersonalityProvider>
  </ThemeProvider>
</AIProvider>
```

### Storage Strategy

- **LocalForage** (IndexedDB): activities, tasks, routine, journal-entries, sleep-time, wake-time
- **Context State**: Real-time emotion data (mood, energy, amplitude)
- **Computed**: Emotion graphs, timelines, metrics

### Performance Optimizations

- Debounced voice amplitude updates (16ms)
- Memoized gradient calculations
- Lazy particle rendering (only when voice active)
- Interval-based timeline updates (1 min)
- Background process detection (sleep mode)

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Voice Not Detected

- Check microphone permissions in browser settings
- Ensure HTTPS (required for getUserMedia)
- Try Safari/Chrome (best Web Audio support)

### Particles Not Showing

- Check browser supports CSS backdrop-filter
- Reduce particle count in EnvironmentSimulator.jsx
- Disable "Reduce Motion" in OS accessibility settings

### Dream Mode Not Activating

- Ensure time is between 10 PM - 6 AM
- Wait 2 hours with no activity
- Check LocalForage is not cleared by browser
